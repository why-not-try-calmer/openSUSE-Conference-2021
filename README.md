# How to view the slides
https://why-not-try-calmer.github.io/openSUSE-Conference-2021/ is where you want to go.

Other options are as follows:
* the [the pdf export](https://github.com/why-not-try-calmer/openSUSE-Conference-2021/blob/master/exports/slides-export.pdf) (unfortunately the export butchered the image position); or
* the (rendered) source of the [slides.md](https://github.com/why-not-try-calmer/openSUSE-Conference-2021/blob/master/slides.md) (no image); or
* otherwise you can clone this repo and do
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
and then visit http://localhost:3030
