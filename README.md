# How to view the slides
I haven't got time to build the slides as a Single-Page Application yet. In the mean time you have three options:
* use [the pdf export](https://github.com/why-not-try-calmer/openSUSE-Conference-2021/blob/master/exports/slides-export.pdf) (unfortunately the export butchered the image position); or
* use [slides.md](https://github.com/why-not-try-calmer/openSUSE-Conference-2021/blob/master/slides.md) (no image); or
* for the best viewing experience you can clone this repo and do
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
and then visit http://localhost:3030
