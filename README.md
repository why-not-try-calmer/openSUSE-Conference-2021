# Disclaimer
I haven't got time to build the slides as a Single-Page Application yet. In the mean time you have two options:
* use [slides.md](https://github.com/why-not-try-calmer/openSUSE-Conference-2021/blob/master/slides.md); or
* clone this repo and do
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
and then visit http://localhost:3030
